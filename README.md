# Probabilistic and machine-learning methods for predicting local rates of transcription elongation from nascent RNA sequencing data

## Overview
In this study, we revisit the questions about the determinants of local elongation rates through gene bodies using a fundamentally different statistical modeling approach.  Our method is based on a recently developed "unified model" for nascent RNA sequencing (NRS) data, which describes both the kinetics of Pol II movement on the DNA template and the generation of NRS read counts (see [Siepel 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.426408v1) and [Zhao et al 2023](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/21/e106/7331020)). 

We adapt this model to allow for a continuously variable elongation rate along the genome, using a generalized linear model to capture the relationship between the local rate and nearby genomic features (see [Liu et al 2023](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.21.572932v1)). By accounting for differences across genes in initiation rate, we are able to efficiently pool information across genes, and extract high-resolution information about relative local elongation rates from steady-state data. 

Here, we provide scripts of the implementation, and demonstrate how quantify both previously known and novel correlates of elongation rate through estimation of coefficients $\kappa$. We then use our models to predict nucleotide-specific elongation rates $\zeta_i$ genome-wide and make our predictions available in a UCSC Genome Browser track.

## Dependencies

GLM is implemented in the statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and depends on a couple of packages. One of the easiest ways to install them is via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

```
conda env create --file pub_glm_env.yaml
```

Once installed, you can activate the environment then run the examples within it,

```
conda activate pub_glm
```

Data for the examples below can be downloaded from [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/u/lingjie_liu/h/glm-test-data), and should be assumed to be stored within the data directory. 



## Examples

```
usage: Rscript ./estimate_epigenomic_kappa.R [-h] -i InputFile [-c Category]
                                             [-l_s LearningSize]

                     covariates
  -c Category        category of input (name of cell line or simulation)

```

**Simulation data** <br>
We first tested our modeling approach on data simulated with [SimPol](https://github.com/CshlSiepelLab/SimPol), which tracks the movement of individual RNA polymerases along the DNA templates in thousands of cells under user-defined rates, and then samples NRS read counts in proportion to the steady-state polymerase density. For this study, we extended SimPol to consider synthetic epigenomic correlates, which we tiled along each synthetic DNA template using a block-sampling approach based on real data for CTCF transcription binding sites, four different histone marks, and RNA stem-loops. The gene coordinates of the simulated gene bodies, the synthetic NRS read counts generated by SimPol, and the simulated feature covariates are merged together. Eighty percent of this data is used as the training data for estimating kappa, and consequently serves as the input for `estimate_epigenomic_kappa.R`. <br>

The input file `-i` for the simulation analysis looks like below; `seqnames`, `start`, `end`, `strand`, `ensembl_gene_id` are gene coordinates; `score` is synthetic NRS read counts;  the remaining columns are covariates.
